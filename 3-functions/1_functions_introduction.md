# C Functions

In this tutorial, you will be introduced to functions (both user-defined and standard library functions) in C programming. Also, you will learn why functions are used in programming.

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

Suppose, you need to create a program to create a circle and color it. You can create two functions to solve this problem:

* create a circle function
* create a color function

Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand to reuse.

## Types of function

There are two types of function in C programming:

* Standard library functions
* User-defined functions

### Standard library functions

The standard library functions are built-in functions in C programming.

These functions are defined in header files. For example,

* The `printf()` is a standard library function to send formatted output to the screen (display output on the screen). This function is defined in the `stdio.h` header file.
Hence, to use the `printf()` function, we need to include the `stdio.h` header file using `#include <stdio.h>`.
* The `sqrt()` function calculates the square root of a number. The function is defined in the `math.h` header file.  

### User-defined function

You can also create functions as per your need. Such functions created by the user are known as user-defined functions.

## How user-defined function works?

```
#include <stdio.h>
void functionName()
{
    ... .. ...
    ... .. ...
}

int main()
{
    ... .. ...
    ... .. ...

    functionName();
    
    ... .. ...
    ... .. ...
}
```

The execution of a C program begins from the `main()` function.

When the compiler encounters `functionName();`, control of the program jumps to

```
void functionName()
```

And, the compiler starts executing the codes inside `functionName()`.

The control of the program jumps back to the `main()` function once code inside the function definition is executed.

How function works in C programming?

Note, function names are identifiers and should be unique.

This is just an overview of user-defined functions. Visit these pages to learn more on:

## Advantages of user-defined function

1. The program will be easier to understand, maintain and debug.
2. Reusable codes that can be used in other programs
3. A large program can be divided into smaller modules. Hence, a large project can be divided among many programmers.
