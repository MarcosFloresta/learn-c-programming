# C Data Types

In this tutorial, you will learn about basic data types such as int, float, char etc. in C programming.

In C programming, data types are declarations for variables. This determines the type and size of data associated with variables. For example,

```
int myVar;
```

Here, `myVar` is a variable of `int` (integer) type. The size of `int` is 4 bytes.

## Basic types

Here's a table containing commonly used types in C programming for quick access.


| Type	   | Size (bytes)	| Format Specifier |
| ------- | ------- | -------|
| int | at least 2, usually 4 | %d |
| char | 1 | %c |
| float | 4 | %f |
| double | 8 | %lf |
| short int | 2 usually	| %hd |
| unsigned int | at least 2, usually 4 | %u |
| long int | at least 4, usually 8 | %li |
| long long int | at least 8 | %lli |
| unsigned long int | at least 4 | %lu |
| unsigned long long int | at least 8 | %llu |
| signed char | 1 | %c |
| unsigned char | 1 | %c |
| long double | at least 10, usually 12 or 16 | %Lf |

## int

Integers are whole numbers that can have both zero, positive and negative values but no decimal values. For example, `0`, `-5`, `10`

We can use `int` for declaring an integer variable.

```
int id;
```

Here, `id` is a variable of type integer.

You can declare multiple variables at once in C programming. For example,

```
int id, age;
```

The size of `int` is usually 4 bytes (32 bits). And, it can take `2^32` distinct states from `-2147483648` to `2147483647`.

## float and double

`float` and `double` are used to hold real numbers.

```
float salary;
double price;
```

In C, floating-point numbers can also be represented in exponential. For example,

```
float normalizationFactor = 22.442e2;
```

What's the difference between `float` and `double`?

The size of `float` (single precision float data type) is 4 bytes. And the size of `double` (double precision float data type) is 8 bytes.

## char

Keyword `char` is used for declaring character type variables. For example,

```
char test = 'h';
```

The size of the character variable is 1 byte.

## void

`void` is an incomplete type. It means "nothing" or "no type". You can think of void as **absent**.

For example, if a function is not returning anything, its return type should be `void`.

Note that, you cannot create variables of `void` type.

## short and long
`
If you need to use a large number, you can use a type specifier `long`. Here's how:

```
long a;
long long b;
long double c;
```

Here variables `a` and `b` can store integer values. And, `c` can store a floating-point number.

If you are sure, only a small integer (`[âˆ’32,767, +32,767]` range) will be used, you can use `short`.

```
short d;
```

You can always check the size of a variable using the sizeof() operator.

```
#include <stdio.h>      
int main() {
  short a;
  long b;
  long long c;
  long double d;
  printf("size of short = %d bytes\n", sizeof(a));
  printf("size of long = %d bytes\n", sizeof(b));
  printf("size of long long = %d bytes\n", sizeof(c));
  printf("size of long double= %d bytes\n", sizeof(d));
  return 0;
}
```

## signed and unsigned

In C, `signed` and `unsigned` are type modifiers. You can alter the data storage of a data type by using them. For example,

```
unsigned int x;
int y;
```

Here, the variable `x` can hold only zero and positive values because we have used the `unsigned` modifier.

Considering the size of `int` is 4 bytes, variable `y` can hold values from `-2^31` to `2^31 -1`, whereas variable `x` can hold values from `0` to `2^32 -1`.

## Other data types defined in C programming are:

* bool Type
* Enumerated type
* Complex types

***
## Derived Data Types

Data types that are derived from fundamental data types are derived types. For example: arrays, pointers, function types, structures, etc.
