# C switch Statement

In this tutorial, you will learn to create the switch statement in C programming with the help of an example.

The switch statement allows us to execute one code block among many alternatives.

You can do the same thing with the `if...else..if` ladder. However, the syntax of the switch statement is much easier to read and write.

## Syntax of switch...case

```
switch (expression)
â€‹{
    case constant1:
      // statements
      break;
    case constant2:
      // statements
      break;
    .
    .
    .
    default:
      // default statements
}
```

### How does the switch statement work?

The `expression` is evaluated once and compared with the values of each `case` label.

* If there is a match, the corresponding statements after the matching label are executed. For example, if the value of the expression is equal to `constant2`, statements after `case constant2`: are executed until `break` is encountered.
* If there is no match, the default statements are executed.

If we do not use `break`, all statements after the matching label are executed.

By the way, the `default` clause inside the `switch` statement is optional.

Example: Simple Calculator
```
// Program to create a simple calculator
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char operator;
    double n1, n2;
    printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ");
    scanf("%c", &operator);
    printf("Enter two operands: ");
    scanf("%lf %lf",&n1, &n2);
    switch(operator)
    {
        case '+':
            printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf",n1, n2, n1+n2);
            break;
        case '-':
            printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf",n1, n2, n1-n2);
            break;
        case '*':
            printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf",n1, n2, n1*n2);
            break;
        case '/':
            printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf",n1, n2, n1/n2);
            break;
        // operator doesn't match any case constant +, -, *, /
        default:
            printf("Error! operator is not correct");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
Enter an operator (+, -, *,): -
Enter two operands: 32.5
12.4
32.5 - 12.4 = 20.1
```

The `-` operator entered by the user is stored in the `operator` variable. And, two operands `32.5` and `12.4` are stored in variables `n1` and `n2` respectively.

Since the `operator` is `-`, the control of the program jumps to

```
printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf", n1, n2, n1-n2);
```

Finally, the break statement terminates the `switch` statement
