# C Programming Operators

In this tutorial, you will learn about different operators in C programming with the help of examples.

An operator is a symbol that operates on a value or a variable. For example: `+` is an operator to perform addition.

C has a wide range of operators to perform various operations.

## C Arithmetic Operators

An arithmetic operator performs mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc on numerical values (constants and variables).

| Operator | Meaning of Operator |
| --- | --- |
| `+`	| addition or unary plus |
| `-`	| subtraction or unary minus |
| `*`	| multiplication |
| `/`	| division |
| `%`	|remainder after division (modulo division) |

Example 1: Arithmetic Operators
```
// Working of arithmetic operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 9,b = 4, c;
    
    c = a+b;
    printf("a+b = %d \n",c);
    c = a-b;
    printf("a-b = %d \n",c);
    c = a*b;
    printf("a*b = %d \n",c);
    c = a/b;
    printf("a/b = %d \n",c);
    c = a%b;
    printf("Remainder when a divided by b = %d \n",c);
    
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
a+b = 13
a-b = 5
a*b = 36
a/b = 2
Remainder when a divided by b=1
```

The operators `+`, `-` and `*` computes addition, subtraction, and multiplication respectively as you might have expected.

In normal calculation, `9/4 = 2.25`. However, the output is `2` in the program.

It is because both the variables `a` and `b` are integers. Hence, the output is also an integer. The compiler neglects the term after the decimal point and shows answer `2` instead of `2.25`.

The modulo operator `%` computes the remainder. When `a=9` is divided by `b=4`, the remainder is 1. The `%` operator can only be used with integers.

Suppose `a = 5.0`, `b = 2.0`, `c = 5` and `d = 2`. Then in C programming,

```
// Either one of the operands is a floating-point number
a/b = 2.5  
a/d = 2.5  
c/b = 2.5  

// Both operands are integers
c/d = 2
```

## C Increment and Decrement Operators

C programming has two operators increment `++` and decrement `--` to change the value of an operand (constant or variable) by 1.

Increment `++` increases the value by 1 whereas decrement `--` decreases the value by 1. These two operators are unary operators, meaning they only operate on a single operand.

Example 2: Increment and Decrement Operators
```
// Working of increment and decrement operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 10, b = 100;
    float c = 10.5, d = 100.5;
    printf("++a = %d \n", ++a);
    printf("--b = %d \n", --b);
    printf("++c = %f \n", ++c);
    printf("--d = %f \n", --d);
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
++a = 11
--b = 99
++c = 11.500000
++d = 99.500000
```

Here, the operators `++` and `--` are used as prefixes. These two operators can also be used as postfixes like `a++` and `a--`. Visit this page to learn more about how increment and decrement operators work when used as postfix.

## C Assignment Operators

An assignment operator is used for assigning a value to a variable. The most common assignment operator is `=`

| Operator | Example | Same as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| =	| a = b	| a = b |
| += | a += b | a = a+b |
| -= | a -= b | a = a-b |
| *= | a *= b | a = a*b |
| /= | a /= b | a = a/b |
| %= | a %= b | a = a%b |

Example 3: Assignment Operators
```
// Working of assignment operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 5, c;
    c = a;      // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c += a;     // c is 10 
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c -= a;     // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c *= a;     // c is 25
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c /= a;     // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c %= a;     // c = 0
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
c = 5 
c = 10 
c = 5 
c = 25 
c = 5 
c = 0
```

## C Relational Operators

A relational operator checks the relationship between two operands. If the relation is `true`, it `returns 1`; if the relation is `false`, it returns `value 0`.

Relational operators are used in decision making and loops.

| Operator | Meaning of Operator | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `==` | Equal to | 5 == 3 is evaluated to 0 |
| `>` | Greater than | 5 > 3 is evaluated to 1 |
| `<` | Less than | 5 < 3 is evaluated to 0 |
| `!=` | Not equal to | 5 != 3 is evaluated to 1 |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | 5 >= 3 is evaluated to 1 |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | 5 <= 3 is evaluated to 0 |


Example 4: Relational Operators
```
// Working of relational operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 5, b = 5, c = 10;
    printf("%d == %d is %d \n", a, b, a == b);
    printf("%d == %d is %d \n", a, c, a == c);
    printf("%d > %d is %d \n", a, b, a > b);
    printf("%d > %d is %d \n", a, c, a > c);
    printf("%d < %d is %d \n", a, b, a < b);
    printf("%d < %d is %d \n", a, c, a < c);
    printf("%d != %d is %d \n", a, b, a != b);
    printf("%d != %d is %d \n", a, c, a != c);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d \n", a, b, a >= b);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d \n", a, c, a >= c);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d \n", a, b, a <= b);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d \n", a, c, a <= c);
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
5 == 5 is 1
5 == 10 is 0
5 > 5 is 0
5 > 10 is 0
5 < 5 is 0
5 < 10 is 1
5 != 5 is 0
5 != 10 is 1
5 >= 5 is 1
5 >= 10 is 0
5 <= 5 is 1
5 <= 10 is 1 
```

## C Logical Operators

An expression containing logical operator returns either 0 or 1 depending upon whether expression results true or false. Logical operators are commonly used in decision making in C programming.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `&&` | Logical AND. True only if all operands are true | If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) && (d>5)) equals to 0. |
| `||` | Logical OR. True only if either one operand is true | If c = 5 and d = 2 then, expression ((c==5) || (d>5)) equals to 1. |
| `!` | Logical NOT. True only if the operand is 0 | If c = 5 then, expression !(c==5) equals to 0. |

Example 5: Logical Operators
```
// Working of logical operators
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 5, b = 5, c = 10, result;
    result = (a == b) && (c > b);
    printf("(a == b) && (c > b) is %d \n", result);
    result = (a == b) && (c < b);
    printf("(a == b) && (c < b) is %d \n", result);
    result = (a == b) || (c < b);
    printf("(a == b) || (c < b) is %d \n", result);
    result = (a != b) || (c < b);
    printf("(a != b) || (c < b) is %d \n", result);
    result = !(a != b);
    printf("!(a == b) is %d \n", result);
    result = !(a == b);
    printf("!(a == b) is %d \n", result);
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
(a == b) && (c > b) is 1 
(a == b) && (c < b) is 0 
(a == b) || (c < b) is 1 
(a != b) || (c < b) is 0 
!(a != b) is 1 
!(a == b) is 0 
```

### Explanation of logical operator program

* (a == b) && (c > 5) evaluates to 1 because both operands (a == b) and (c > b) is 1 (true).
* (a == b) && (c < b) evaluates to 0 because operand (c < b) is 0 (false).
* (a == b) || (c < b) evaluates to 1 because (a = b) is 1 (true).
* (a != b) || (c < b) evaluates to 0 because both operand (a != b) and (c < b) are 0 (false).
* !(a != b) evaluates to 1 because operand (a != b) is 0 (false). Hence, !(a != b) is 1 (true).
* !(a == b) evaluates to 0 because (a == b) is 1 (true). Hence, !(a == b) is 0 (false).

## C Bitwise Operators

During computation, mathematical operations like: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc are converted to bit-level which makes processing faster and saves power.

Bitwise operators are used in C programming to perform bit-level operations.

| Operators | eaning of operators |
| --- | --- |
| `&` | Bitwise AND |
| `|` | Bitwise OR |
| `^` | Bitwise exclusive OR |
| `~` | Bitwise complement |
| `<<` | Shift left |
| `>>` | Shift right |

## Other Operators

### Comma Operator

Comma operators are used to link related expressions together. For example:
 
 ```
int a, c = 5, d;
```

### The sizeof operator

The `sizeof` is a unary operator that returns the size of data (constants, variables, array, structure, etc).

Example 6: sizeof Operator
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a;
    float b;
    double c;
    char d;
    printf("Size of int=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(a));
    printf("Size of float=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(b));
    printf("Size of double=%lu bytes\n",sizeof(c));
    printf("Size of char=%lu byte\n",sizeof(d));
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
Size of int = 4 bytes
Size of float = 4 bytes
Size of double = 8 bytes
Size of char = 1 byte
```

Other operators such as ternary operator `?:`, reference operator `&`, dereference operator `*` and member selection operator `->` will be discussed in later tutorials.
